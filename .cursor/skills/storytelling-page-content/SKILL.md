# Storytelling Page Content

## When to Apply

- User asks to "write the content of the page" or "write copy" for a page
- User wants hero text, section headlines, or body copy improved with storytelling
- User mentions "storytelling" in the context of page or web content
- User asks for more engaging, narrative, or persuasive copy for services or marketing

## Storytelling Structure for Pages

Treat each page (or section) as a short story with a clear arc:

1. **Hook** — Grab attention and state the promise or desire (headline, subhead, first line).
2. **Stakes / Why it matters** — Connect to the reader’s situation, problem, or aspiration.
3. **Journey** — Show how the product/service fits: benefits, proof, or a before/after.
4. **Payoff** — Reinforce the outcome or transformation they get.
5. **CTA** — One clear next step, phrased as an action or invitation.

Apply this arc at **page level** (hero → sections → CTA) and within **sections** (heading → supporting copy → sub-CTA if needed).

**Creating new content** — Propose full copy following the arc; label each block. **Revising existing** — Keep what works; tighten hooks, sharpen headlines, and align CTAs to the arc.

## Page-Type Guidelines

### Hero

- **Headline**: One clear idea; lead with benefit or outcome, not the company name. Aim for ~5–12 words.
- **Subhead / supporting line**: Expand the promise in one sentence; use "you" and concrete outcomes. ~15–25 words.
- **Optional eyebrow/kicker**: Short label (e.g. brand or category) only if it adds clarity.
- Keep hero copy scannable; avoid long paragraphs above the fold.

### Section blocks

- **Section headline**: Outcome or theme, not generic "Our Services."
- **Body**: 1–3 short paragraphs; one main idea per paragraph. Use concrete details and sensory or emotional language where it fits the brand.
- **Flow**: Order sections so the story builds (problem/desire → solution → proof → next step).

### Service / product copy

- Open with what the customer gets or feels, not feature lists.
- Weave in one or two concrete examples or use cases.
- End with a natural next step (e.g. "Get a quote," "See options").

### CTAs

- Button/link text: Specific action or outcome ("Request a quote," "Explore services") rather than generic "Submit" or "Learn more" when possible.
- Surrounding line: One short sentence that reinforces why to act now (e.g. "We’ll respond within 24 hours").

## Tone and Voice

- **Consistent**: Match the existing site voice (e.g. premium and warm vs. minimal and direct).
- **Clear**: Prefer short sentences and everyday words; avoid jargon unless the audience expects it.
- **Concrete**: Use specific outcomes, numbers, or scenarios instead of vague claims.
- **Inclusive**: Use "you" and "your" to speak to the reader; avoid overuse of "we" in hero and key sections.

## Output Format

When writing or revising content:

- Provide copy in **plain text or short markdown** (headings, paragraphs, list items) so it can be dropped into components.
- If the page structure is known, label blocks (e.g. `Hero headline`, `Hero subhead`, `Section: Why us – headline`, `CTA button`).
- Offer **one primary version**; add 1–2 optional variants only for hero or CTA when it helps the user choose.

## Examples (before → after)

**Headline**
- Weak: "Welcome to Aruma Events"
- Strong: "Creating Unforgettable Moments" or "Your Vision, Brought to Life"

**Subhead**
- Weak: "We offer event services."
- Strong: "Transform your vision into reality with premium décor and an extensive rental collection—from intimate gatherings to grand celebrations."

**CTA**
- Weak: "Submit" / "Learn more"
- Strong: "Request a quote" / "Explore services" / "See what’s possible"

## Avoid

- **Feature dumps** — Lead with outcome or feeling, not a list of what you offer.
- **Vague claims** — Replace "best," "quality," "excellent" with concrete outcomes or proof.
- **Generic section titles** — Prefer "Why couples choose us" over "Our services."
- **Long hero paragraphs** — Keep above-the-fold copy to headline + one short supporting line (and optional eyebrow).
