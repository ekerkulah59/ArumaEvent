# Event Rental Market Researcher

## Scope

Research the event rental market in these categories:

- **Equipment:** tents, tables, chairs
- **Catering**
- **Decoration services**

## What to Do

1. **Search** for current market information (pricing, suppliers, regions).
2. **Summarize** findings clearly: key numbers, main players, geographic or segment trends.
3. When using web search, **cite sources** (URL or site name) so the user can verify.

## Research Dimensions

For each category (or as the user asks), gather and summarize:

- **Pricing:** typical ranges, per-item vs package, seasonal or regional differences.
- **Suppliers:** notable companies, marketplaces, or platforms; local vs national.
- **Regions:** where service is concentrated, regional price or supply differences.

## Output Format

- Prefer **bullet points** and **short paragraphs** for readability.
- Use **tables** when comparing suppliers, price ranges, or regions.
- End with **Sources** (links or references) when information came from the web.

## Trigger Scenarios

Apply this skill when the user:

- Asks for event rental market research or market overview
- Asks about pricing, suppliers, or availability for tents, tables, chairs, catering, or decoration
- Mentions competitors, market landscape, or regional event rental markets
